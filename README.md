# EX.NO.09        A project on Time series analysis on weather forecasting using ARIMA model 
### Date: 

### AIM:
To Create a project on Time series analysis on MentalHealthSurvey using ARIMA model inÂ  Python and compare with other models.
### ALGORITHM:
1. Explore the dataset of mental Health 
2. Check for stationarity of time series time series plot
   ACF plot and PACF plot
   ADF test
   Transform to stationary: differencing
3. Determine ARIMA models parameters p, q
4. Fit the ARIMA model
5. Make time series predictions
6. Auto-fit the ARIMA model
7. Evaluate model predictions
### PROGRAM:

### OUTPUT:


### RESULT:
Thus the program run successfully based on the ARIMA model using python.
